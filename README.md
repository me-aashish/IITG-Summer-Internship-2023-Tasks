# IIT Gandhinagar Summer Internship 2023 Tasks

Hi, I'm Aashish Kumar Jha, a CSE undergrad at Chandigarh University, Mohali, Punjab.
This repo contains some tasks related to internship and machine learning. 

## List of Tasks

### Task - 1
[5 Marks] Implement Inverse CDF sampling for the Fréchet distribution. With a sufficient number of samples, plot the kernel density estimation plot and show that you are able to match the PDF. Also, reproduce the following figure and visualize it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frechet_pdf.svg \
